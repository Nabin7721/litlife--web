         <h5 className="spirituality-top-text"> Spirituality Freedoom From All Things</h5>


        <h5 className="consciouse-text">Spirituality is all about  developing a deep metaphysical connection to reality. But what does it really mean to develop a deep metaphysical connection to reality well
        I'll tell you exactly what it means very specific thing the problem though is to get you to understand what I mean. The whole problem with spirituality and metaphysics is that we are talking about
        abstract things. Which are not commonly experienced by most people living a mundane ordinary life so we're sort of going outside the domain of ordinary experience and that makes it difficult to talk
        about but because our entire language and our entire culture mostly talks about things that are within our mundane domains of experience.</h5>
        <h5 className="consciouse-text">So what I really mean by this deep metaphysical connection is I mean a connection to the wonder of existence itself to the wonder of nature. Actually if you're a fan of
        science and you're a fan of deep inquiry empirical inquiry to the nature of reality. Then you should be actually quite familiar with this sense of wonder that I'm talking about. Let me give you some
        examples, for example when you're out in nature perhaps at a national park and you're looking at some beautiful sunset over the mountains and it's amazing, it's wonderful. During that moment your
        consciousness feels like it's elevated and you feel this sense of wonder I don't just mean a feeling a good feeling or a good emotion I mean something deeper I mean that you're actually connecting
        to the profundity of a distance itself and also to its beauty but again not in a superficial way of like oh that's a beautiful picture.But I mean you're connecting to something within existence itself
        that strikes you as beautiful as awesome as wondrous as mysterious you connect to it.</h5>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>when you look up at the stars and if you're scientifically minded you know how many stars there are. You know the estimates, you know how many billions of galaxies and
        billions of star systems and billions of planets and all of this and you think about that as you're looking up at the sky and it just gives you a sense of awe and wonder. Again, which are connecting 
        to there is that metaphysical connection of profundity you're starting to sense that there's something about existence which is way deeper than we conventionally talk about or think about in our everyday
        lives. Now that is a little part of what spirituality means and is about. </h5>

        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>IMAGINE A VAST hall in anglo-saxon England, not long after the passing of King Arthur. It is the dead of winter and a fierce snow storm rages outside, but a great fire
        fills the space within the hall with warmth and light. Now and then, a sparrow darts in for refuge from the weather. It appears as if from nowhere, flits about joyfully in the light, and then disappears again and where it
        comes from and where it goes next in that stormy darkness, we don't know. Our lives are like that, suggests an old story in Bede’s medieval history of England. We spend our days in the familiar world of our
        five senses, but what lies beyond that, if anything, we have no idea. Those sparrows are hints of something more. Most of us are happy to stay where we are. We may ever be a bit afraid to venture into the unknown.
        What would be the point, we ask. Why should we leave the world we know? Yet there are always a few who are not content to spend their lives indoors. Simply knowing there is something unknown beyond their reach makes
        them acutely restless. They have to see what lies outside - if only, as George Mallory said of Everest, “because it’s there.”</h5>

        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>This is true of adventurers of every kind, but especially of those who seek to explore not mountains or jungles but consciousness itself: whose real drive, we might say, is not
        so much to know the unknown as to knower. Such men and women can be found in every age and every culture. While the rest of us stay put, they quietly slip out to see what lies beyond. Then, so far as we can tell, they
        disappear. We have no idea where they have gone; we can’t even imagine.  But every now and then, like friends who have run off to some exotic land, they send back reports: breathless messages describing fantastic adventures,
        rambling letters about a world beyond ordinary experience, urgent telegrams begging us to come and see. “Look at this view! Isn’t it breathtaking? Wish you could see this. Wish you were here.”</h5>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>The works in this set of translations - the upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Dhammapada  - are among the earliest and most universal of messages like these, to inform us that there
        is more to life than the everyday experience of our senses. The upanishads are the oldest, so varied that some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the photos, postcards, and letters from this world that they
        could find, without any regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form a kind of ecstatic slide-show - snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and
        dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation. But those who have traveled those heights will recognize the views: “Oh, yes, that's Everest from the northwest - must be late spring. And here we’re south, in the full snows of winter.”</h5>
        <img class="Meditation-page-pic-01" alt='actro-drawing' height='800px' src="god3.jpg"></img>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'> The Dhammapda, too, is a collection - traditionally, sayings of the Buddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness. In this case the messages have been sorted, but not by a scheme
        that makes sense to us today. Instead of being grouped by theme or topic, they are gathered according to some dominant characteristic like a symbol or metaphor- flowers, birds, a river, the sky - that makes them easy to commit to memory.
        If the Upanishads are like slides, the Dhammapada seems more like a field guide. This lore was picked up by someone who knows every step of the way through these strange lands. He can’t take us there, he explains, but he can show us the
        way: tell us what to look for, warn about missteps, advise us about detours, tell us what to avoid. Most importantly, he urges us that it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves. Everything else is secondary. 
        And the third of these classics, the Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and guidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various approaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers recommendations, tells us what
        to pack and what to leave behind. More than either of the others it gives the sense of personal guide. It asks and answers the questions that you and I might ask - questions not about philosophy or mysticism, but about how to live effectively
        in a world of challenge and change. Of these three, it is the Gita that has been my own personal guidebook, just as it was Mahatma Gandhi’s. </h5>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>These three texts are very personal records of a landscape that is both real and universal. Their voices, passionately human, speak directly to you and me. They describe the topography of consciousness itself,
        which belongs as much to us today as to these largely anonymous seers thousands of years ago. If the landscape seems dark in the light of sense perception, they tell us, it has an illumination of its own, and this “divine dark” and verify their
        descriptions for ourselves. And this world, they insist, is where we belong. This wider field of consciousness is our native land. We are not cabindwellers, born to a life cramped and confined; we are meant to explore, to seek, to push the limits
        of our potential as humans, meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world of physical reality.</h5>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'>This is a message that thrills men and women in every age and culture. It is for such kindred spirits that these texts were originally composed, and it is for them in our time that I undertook these translations, in the conviction that they deserve
        an audience today as much as ever. If these text speak to even a handful of such readers, they will have served their purpose.</h5>
        <h5 className='consciouse-text'> All through out our evolutaion humans have been teling the story about ourself about who we truly are and why we are here and now. If you could understand what they are point at through their 
          story then you will now know what they are talk about. That is non other than your Higest self that is the WHOLE CREATION. The stories comes in different flavor and differest style but it all follows the main narative that is the quest to find the Truth. For instance take any religion 
          what is the stories about  you might say well it is about a man or women who was not satisfied with their current state so there was a calling for them from the inside so they went into the Journey to discover the truth and when they realize the truth it completely change them. Therefore they realize that this
         what everyone is looking for but they dont know how to get it so they taught this truth to the whole world.
