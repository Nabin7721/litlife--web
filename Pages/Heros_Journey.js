            <p className='consciouse-text'>This text is about understanding the highest hero's journey. Through this text I try to explain to you in a certain angle in the angle I come out of
            from there is a very practical one where I show you how to take this framework of the hero's journey and apply it to build your career building business. To find your sense of
            purpose and the kind of impact you wanna have with your life in society. How you want to contribute to the world and so I will talk a lot about it. I want to cover it from a
            different angle and this is the perhaps even more important angle of spirituality non-duality so what is the interconnection between the Hero's Journey Spirituality and Non-Duality.
            </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>When researching this topic about hero’s journey I stumbled upon Joseph Campbell who is the American mythologist and Scholar of comparative religion who
            was one of the inspirations for Star Wars and he's the guy who came up with the whole concept that we now call the hero's journey. He's just the one who made it popular and made it
            explicit in our consciousness over the last 50 years. so let's get the foundation going because we need to understand what we're talking about when we need the hero's journey. Before
            I can give you my insight on how it relates to spirituality here's my summary for you of what the hero's journey is. It is a very illuminating thing to understand because this here, in
            a sense is a nutshell of what life is all about. You have to see through the illusion of what the movie is portraying about the character development of the heroes and you have to be able
            to see how this fits in with your practical everyday life.  </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>The hero's journey begins just by seeing the hero in his everyday ordinary existence living with his tribe or his people in his village or town. At this point
            he's not really a hero he's just an ordinary guy or girl. In this ordinary existence, he's very comfortable and it's just a very sort of boring average existence not special at all. Then
            what happens though the hero is presented with a call to action. The call to action is the window of opportunity that is presented to the hero that tests whether he wants to go on an adventure
            or not. Something new and something radical comes into his existence which beckons him to go on this adventure. An of course what does the hero do does he accept the adventure no because to be
            psychologically accurate here we have to recognize that the human psyche is very lazy. It’s stuck in homeostasis and it wants to maintain its ordinary comfortable mundane existence and it’s very
            risk-averse. A very fearful so if I come to you now say hey come on my rocket ship and I'm going to fly you to a new planet a new galaxy and there we are going to battle dragons and space aliens
            together.  What are you going to say are you going to say yes let's do it let's go right now,  no it might seem at first like yeah that's what I want to do that sounds fun. But you got to understand
            that it’s one thing to be watching this on the Silver Screen when it is happening to somebody else. It is another thing to be in the hero’s shoes so I want you right now to put yourself in the hero’s
            shoes, so if I come to you and tell you hey you are come to me to the new galaxy to fight space dragons and stuff. What are you going to say you can say hell no I got to go to work tomorrow, I got to
            pay the bills, I gotta feed the kids, I got to prepare food I got all this stuff to do I got all these commitments I got all these obligations. I don't have time to fly out there I'm tired I was working
            10 hours today.  I'm not going to go out there and fly with you somewhere to risk what to risk my life my health my security for what to go on some wild-goose chase no way I'm not going to do that. So you
            reject the call to action that what 99% of people do actually including the hero. The hero is pretty ordinary what happens next though is that finally he's forced to accept the call to action because the call
            to action imposes itself upon him.</p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>Classically like in Star Wars what happened to get Luke to go on an adventure well the stormtroopers had to destroy his home, his family, and everyone he knows right. So now he's
            got no choice his whole family and house have been destroyed he's got nowhere to go. So of course now he has to go on an adventure so something like this happens right he's forced to accept the call. By extraordinary
            circumstance and so he ventures out into unknown territory which is dangerous and he's not sure what he's going to find there is full of risks, and this is where the adventure begins. The first thing that happens
            to him is he faces the threshold guardian one of many that he will face the threshold guardian is an archetype, which is your first obstacle whenever you go on any Journey. So I don't know if you've ever encountered
            this but have you ever gone on to road trip and you plan out this road trip, it is going to be this long faraway destination that you're going to so you are excited. You are on the way to this trip so you're using your
            car you're driving for the first hundred miles and then you get a flat tire. That's your first threshold guardian is that first flat tire because what that does is that it’s test whether you want to go on this trip or
            not whether you're serious about it. Most people when they face that first threshold guardian they’re defeated and they crawl back to their old existence. But the hero sees that there's a bigger vision here he knows
            that there's something bigger he's fighting for so he tries to overcome that threshold guardian. Maybe he succeeds or maybe he fails if he fails then he needs to go and find a mentor that will teach him how to do battle.
            An train him and maybe give him some secret weapon, a magic potion, a Lightsaber, a mirror shield some kind of armor to sort of the amulet you know something that serves him as a weapon or a tool on this journey for overcoming
            all the tough obstacles that will be ahead. </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>He finds his mentor and he gets his training and then he goes off to face more threshold guardians a with this training of course with the mentor’s advice he can defeat the threshold guardians.
            An go further and deeper into uncharted territory now the mentor is an important point what is the mentor.  Well of course the mentor is a hero himself from a past generation so he or she is usually a wise old man or woman who
            has already gone through this journey themself. Now they are there to give advice and training to new heroes who come about trying to accomplish the same thing. We'll get back to that later anyways the hero with the training goes
            off he faces more threshold guardians he defeats them and finally, he has to face the final boss. What is the final boss? The final boss is let's save the dragon which guards the holy grail and the hero is after the Holy Grail. So he's
            just not on this adventure for a lark he's on this adventure because he's been promised there's something valuable at the end of this journey for him. That is what we call the Holy Grail or the Elixir of Life or he's trying to save the
            damsel in distress and she's the holy grail and she's of course behind the dragon so he has to defeat the dragon. Usually what happens is that when the first encounter the dragon this is like the final boss in the video game there are minor
            bosses before the final boss. The final boss is a really tough one and when you first face the final boss you usually fail you have to go back and lick your wounds and rethink your strategy. </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>Therefore the hero does that and this leads to the most important aspects psychologically speaking of the entire Journey which is what's called entering the Belly Of The Whale. This is where the hero has to know
            face himself he has to rethink his whole life and the whole approach to his journey. Therefore he has to face his inner demons because he recognizes that the things that are holding him from successfully defeating the final boss are his inner
            demons and weaknesses and fears. That's really where the war gets waged on the inside so he goes he turns inside he faces himself. He conquers his inner demons that is the hardest point in the journey. Once he gets past that now he's free and
            he can go and he can fight the dragon and defeat the dragon, therefore, get the Holy Grail. Now interesting thing happens when he gets the Holy Grail there is a one hundred eighty degree reversal of what the Holy Grail was all about. Originally
            he thought he would go defeat this dragon and get the Holy Grail and live happily ever after because he now has his prize or all the gold, jewels, or something like that. Now that would make him happy but as soon as he reaches the Holy Grail
            and he puts his hands on it. He realizes that the journey was not really about the Holy Grail. The Journey was about who he became to get the grail. Now that is really what the holy grail is so in a sense he surrenders the physical material
            Holy Grail the treasure. That's not important anymore and he finds his peace and his happiness in who he has become and simply in being the new more powerful version of self that now he has become by going on this whole journey. In a sense,
            this is a  journey to find himself and so he's found himself at that point the grail becomes insignificant the real grail is finding yourself.</p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>As a result, so he takes the grail both the physical one and the immaterial one and now he returns home back to his tribe or town to share the lessons that he has to learn but, of course, the irony here is that the
            tribe cannot comprehend his lessons because they have not gone on this journey themselves. They are stuck in complacency and they are stuck in group thinking and so when he tries to communicate and share the lessons with this tribe it falls on deaf ears.
            So the hero then retires and he now is there and available to any new hero from the tribe if they decide to accept a new call as part of a  new generation of heroes. Now the old hero is available as a mentor to train and guild the new young generation of
            heroes should arise.  But that's a rare thing because very few people from the tribe want to be heroes. They are comfortable living in their mundane ordinary existence so in a sense the circle completes itself. That is a hero's journey as described by Joseph Campbell.</p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>Joseph Campbell is very interesting to study and how he arrived at the hero's journey and his formulations of it.  He was in mythologist and he studied a lot of mythological traditions from cultures around the entire Globe across various eras
            generations. He discusses these consistent threads and patterns throughout all the mythology of human beings, whether it was from Africa, Asia, Europe, or anywhere else this is what he found is that there's the hero's journey. It's always described as slightly different language
            and it looks different you're fighting different monsters there are different types of mentors there are different threshold guardians and the Holy Grail is always different but in the end, the structure here is the same. This structure is very important for you to understand for
            your life this structure is what the human life is in the sense. But goes deeper than just that because of the real journey and this is what most people miss and this is why I wanted to communicate this teaching to you is to not just to tell you about the physical journey fighting
            dragons and monsters. You know that you've watched plenty of movies where that has happened and you probably heard about the hero's journey already. But what you probably don't know is that the real journey is all done on the inside that's the key takeaway that I want you to learn here.
            Joseph Campbell derived the core of the hero's journey from Vedanta. </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>The Vedanta is a Hindu philosophy of Non-Duality it's one of the oldest spiritual traditions and philosophies that we have it's several thousand years old over two or three thousand years old. Some of the earliest written text in Sanskrit from India that's where
            he derived from. You might ask what is Vedanta about? It is about the pursuit of Enlightenment what I want you to get here is that all the external Journeys are of heroes are just a metaphor for the absolute truth towards Consciousness and Enlightenment. When you see comic books superheroes tv
            shows or reading novels and you see all these great Heroes men and women who seem Valeant. They're fighting against forces of Good and Evil right there fighting evil they are the forces of good. You say yea that's a hero that's kinda how I should be. But understand all of that is a metaphor in
            reality there is no outside battle there are no outside monsters and there is no out evil. The monsters, battle, and the evil is you it is not anything other or separate from you it's you. You are on a journey to fight yourself what you see in the comic books and in the movies, these are childish
            caricatures metaphors that we have confused for the true inner spiritual journey.  That Journey amounts to you taking a stand in your life on one critical issue and here's what that issue is you siding with ego or siding with the truth it's very important.  You are going to have to make this choice
            in your life and it will be made whether you make it consciously or not it will be made by default. If you don't know that you're making it the choice between will you serve your time in this life-serving ego or pursuing the truth with a capital T that's basically what human life boils down to that
            is what the hero's journey boils down to.  </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>What is a hero is someone who chooses truth over the ego and everybody else who's not a hero why are they ordinary why do we not talk about them or care about them because they're just part of the crowd? The crowd always serves ego never serving the truth that is the fundamental choice,
            because evil is literally selfishness or ego and so in the degree to which the hero is good is the degree to which he breaks loyalty with ego. He rejects it and this is a very difficult thing to do is one of the most counterintuitive moves you could make in your life is this choice of truth over ego. If you do choose
            truth or ego then it will completely change your life for the better. Therefore, you will be able to see what reality really is and why you are here.  </p>
            <p className='consciouse-text'>This journey in the highest sense is all about god realization. If you go through this Hero's Journey to the end then you come to realization that everything is god. The whole reality is god experiencing itself in 
            infinite different ways. Therefore god is present in all it is complete and whole so you realize for the first time that you are absolute infinite being with absolute infinite power and love.</p>
