                <h5 className="consciouse-text">I'm going to walk you through a guided meditation, so to show you what is perhaps the least painful and the most pleasant way to meditate. This is
                a live exercise that I want you to do with me. This is not something you just read. This is something you actually have to sit down and do, so find  or  minutes to set aside right
                now or sometime today and do this exercise do not put this off. I'm going to give you just a little brief introduction here but mostly there's not going to be any Theory here.
                I want you to get a direct experience of what it's like to do an awesome meditation session. </h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>Alright so don't put this off remember that if you practice these specific action steps you can start to transform your life. If you dismiss
                them and just say oh that's not important I already know that then you're missing like percentage of the juice.  This is where the power is at learning the theory is not where
                the power is at.  The power is in the practice so start practicing right here if you're new to meditation, then this will be a great introduction it'll show you how to do it
                in a very pleasant way.  If you've already been meditating for a while then this will still be valuable to you because I'm going to introduce a very important critical
                component here which likely your current meditation sessions are missing. Especially if you have this problem where you're frustrated with meditation, so this is going to be
                very valuable for you.</h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'> The important component that I want to introduce to you here is the component of ‘Letting Go’ , the component of surrender too often when we get
                into meditation. We come into it and we have all these objectives such as we want to be a good meditator, we're told to quiet our mind, we're told to let go of thoughts and what
                happens is that we're so busy letting go of thoughts that we end up actually being in control the entire time.  What we don't realize is that the letting go and the surrender
                is a critical part of a successful meditation session and I want to give credit to Shinzen Young and Actualized.org ‘Leo Guru’  who I got this insight from  they really opened
                my eyes to this fact that man I need a less neurotic way to meditate. I need a meditation method where I am really letting go and I'm actually enjoying it rather than sitting there.
                Neurotically trying to manipulate all my thoughts, so this is sort of like the no manipulation method you want to call that but that's all the theory I need to give you. </h5>
                <img  className= 'Meditation-page-pic-01'alt='Lord Ganesha-1' src="https://q4j2g5j9.stackpathcdn.com/ddg-dream/c97ea6afb1353dd6095b055fde7c2652841cd729.jpg"></img>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'> Everything else you're going to learn here in the exercise, so let's get started, go ahead and find a comfortable position preferably seated, not
                lying down, and set aside some time where nobody will distract you. Where you can focus on this because you're going to go pretty deep in a short amount of time, so you're sitting
                in this comfortable position, you're going to close your eyes for the duration of this guided meditation. Go ahead and close your eyes, get comfortable in your seat and just sit for
                a second there and, be still yourself therefore you don't need to sit in some meditative special posture and sit comfortably in a relaxed way.  The way that you would if you were,
                let's say watching your favorite TV show.  Go ahead and take any ideas you have about meditation or any favorite methods that you've been using.  Just put them aside, you won't need
                them, for now, this is something different with your eyes closed and starting to feel into your body.  Just become aware of the various sensations that comprise your body, your feet,
                legs, abdomen, chest and your hands anywhere else in your body. It is you don't need to especially feel into anything just let your awareness wander outside of your skull. </h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>Just let it notice whatever comes into awareness, feel the body including any unpleasant sensations just allow yourself to feel them.  As you're
                sitting here reading do not try to meditate there is nothing for you to do here. There is nothing to accomplish and do not manipulate your experience in any way. There is no need
                to enter into some  kind of special mental state, do not even manipulate yourself into relaxation, do not manipulate your thoughts.  Do not try to stop or to control your thoughts
                but simply let go of control that's it.  That's all you have to do, just let go of control as you sit there in stillness even though your eyes are closed.  You remain wide awake,
                you're awake and alert behind the closed eyelids. Notice the external sensations that are occurring for you right now external sensations are any sensations that are outside of
                your skull including your body.  So if you're noticing your feet that's an external sensation start to notice all the external sensations that are happening outside of your skull.
                Now push yourself out gently, push yourself out of your skull and into the external sensations.  Don't try to do this just notice that it's already done there is nothing to try or to do. </h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>These external sensations are already there and they are already in your awareness and just become reality rather than being something that lives inside your skull.
                Or rather than being a human body sitting there instead becomes all of reality the every sight sound through internal and external sensation becomes all of it.  Don't merely watch it but actually
                be it you don't need to try to do that just notice that it's already the case.  You already are, there is nothing to do here, nothing needs to be manipulated.  In order for you to be reality
                because you are reality every second, no special mental state is required because it's always the case.  There's nothing to try and nothing to do, notice that there is nowhere to go, there
                is nowhere else for you to be then right here. Where can reality run - from itself know when reality is everything that's occurring there is nowhere to run there is nothing to manipulate.
                Just notice that there is nothing to do, notice also that there is nothing to understand or to know or to figure out with your mind. So the mind can be completely let go because there is
                nothing for it to figure out, let go of trying to become enlightened or to have any other kind of  meditative experience. </h5>
                <img className= 'Meditation-page-pic-01'alt='Lord Ganesha-2' src="https://q4j2g5j9.stackpathcdn.com/ddg-dream/936ed0f3b70dc1e41dbb16d80b346bb383d9a247.jpg"></img>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>The meditative experience is always the case, every experience is a meditative experience because meditation is simply what surrenders yourself completely to
                what is surrender the mind and surrender the body. let go of all manipulation even let go of the desire  let go of every struggle let go of any lingering worries that you have let everything
                go, and relax your body fully relax your jaw relax your shoulders relax your arms and your hands release all the tension in your abdomen and relax your legs and as you're relaxing your body
                completely relax your mind do not manipulate anything just notice everything exactly as it is. Notice how relaxed it is to allow everything to just be including anything that's annoying or
                perhaps a bit unpleasant allow that to be . If you have any resistance to letting go or if you have some resistance to an annoying sensation, allow that resistance as well do not manipulate
                your resistance,  just allow it to stop caring about anything there is nothing to care about.  There is no objective you do not even care about being peaceful or calm or relaxed or happy let
                go of caring.  </h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>Just be perfectly still, notice your mind becoming very restful, the mind just shutting down and notice your sense of self,  just getting pulled and absorbed into
                your surrounding environment.  All the sensations that are outside your skull notice yourself just getting absorbed into that and becoming it all. That meditation really is  a resting of the mind.
                For this short period throughout your day your mind will be totally at rest but inside you will be fully alert and awake and be fully alert even though you are fully relaxed. Notice the natural
                spontaneous joy that overcomes you from simply being peacefully alert,  but perfectly still in body and mind outside of your head be all of reality. Notice that this is already the case there 
                nothing to do; surrender any last remaining shreds of the need for control or manipulation and surrender yourself completely to reality. Just sit if you notice thoughts arising allow them to arise
                if you notice a desire for control or manipulation arising just remember to fully surrender and to let go. Just let go of anything that is  distressing you  if you're unable to let something go just
                let go of the desire to let go enjoy your silence, enjoy the reality this is all there is there's nothing else enjoy being aware that awareness is perfectly effortless. You do not need to make an
                effort to be aware, take a few last moments to enjoy the silence and gather any lessons that you learned here from this experience. You can take them with you when you awaken so go ahead and slowly
                open your eyes and come on back.</h5>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>Okay great welcome back so that was a taste of meditation done properly meditation done in a manner where you let go and surrender the ego and you start to merge with
                reality. You may have  noticed that  the merging of reality starts to happen effortlessly when the mind is simply silenced and letting go has occurred. The key lesson here is that you do not silence
                the mind through control and manipulation. But paradoxically just by letting go at first what happens is that your mind can wobble a bit and when you let it go it can run away.  It can go into monkey
                chatter but over time and this can happen rather quickly just within five or ten minutes, if you just keep letting go and letting go and letting go of any desire to not go into monkey mind mode.
                Just keep letting go over and over and over again and you just keep pushing yourself out of your skull a little bit in a very gentle non manipulative sort of way. Then after a while you just enter
                this very very deep peaceful place and then you can sit there for half an hour or whole hour. If you can do that it would be ideal but if you only got  minutes a day do it for only  minutes a day,
                so I hope you got some real first-hand insights about how to do meditation better apply these insights to your current meditation practice. If you don't have any meditation session, start one immediately
                because this is the number one it is a self-improvement habit that you can create. </h5>
                <img className= 'Meditation-page-pic-01'alt='Lord Ganesha-3' src="https://q4j2g5j9.stackpathcdn.com/ddg-dream/d0468cbce64b6f962a2e827d562fde3368142b81.jpg"></img>
                <h5 className='consciouse-text'>That's it, it's simple but it's number one. If you're interested and you want to use what I talked about here as a guided meditation aid and you're just starting off and if
                you don't feel like you can do this with yourself when you're sitting down to meditate then just take the first step to do it. If you do this practice it will  really transform your life. That's what you
                need to get into so stay on track  if you are falling off track and get  distracted. I guarantee it will happen just find yourself and stay on track every single week for one year.  Your life will start
                to change in remarkable ways and if you stay on track  for two or three years. Wow you're going to have some really powerful shifts so stay tuned and also do the practice work, so that in the future you
                can actually have some direct mystical experience because the things I talked about require direct experience. If you're a real lover of the theory you have to become a lover of the practice too because
                after a while you can't get to the deepest theory anymore,  because you don't have enough practice. So if you need to use that little mental trick to trick yourself into practicing more than doing it,
                whatever works you know lots and lots of practice is what's required to transform your life and become the best version of yourself you are meant to be.</h5>
